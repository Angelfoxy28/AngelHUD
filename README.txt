THANKS FOR DOWNLOADING!!

So, this is my first HUD that i made, i hope you like and if you see something that is a bit bad or worse let me know, have in mind that this is a beta.

If you use this in your mod plz credit me with the things in "data/credits.txt" and the images in "images/credits"!!

Finally, if you want to have different healthbars just put the mode in the script ninth line and the credits in the third line

Update 1.0.2

> The mode n°2 now is like a new mode for the game instead of just the healthbar

> The mode n°2 now is complete finally

Future things to come

> Credits could be inside the data folder

> New healthbars
